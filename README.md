# thKaguyaModPort
A fan's attempt to port the beloved Itutu No Nandai MOD+ (aka. Touhou Items Mod) from Minecraft 1.7.10 to 1.12.2.

This mod is currently in development, since I have to cover gap in knowledge from 1.7 to 1.12
If you'd like to help, it will be much appreciated. DM me on github and I'd be more than happy to welcome you to join.
